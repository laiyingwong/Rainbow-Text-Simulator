# üåà Rainbow Text Simulator 


The rainbow text simulator features a stormy weather background with the quote "Weather the storm, and you will see the rainbow". A cute rainbow cursor will appear when one hovers over the word *rainbow*, which will then change *rainbow*'s text color and font style, as well as replacing the background with a rainbow image. The newly applied effects will be removed after 3s.

## ‚ú® Inspiration

This is my very first DOM manipulation mini project! üåà Inspired by a rainbow text exercise, in which I was asked to iterate over some text in an HTML file and make them rainbow-colored using JavaScript, I came up with the idea of making a project with more visually stimulating effects than simply changing the text color. 

When implementing the features I envisioned, I incoporated the practice of creating, prepending, and removing elements in the DOM, as well as attaching and experimenting with different event handlers. I also spent a lot of time googling and reading documentations for some issues I ran into (e.g. right element was selected but it returned null when I added event handler on it -- and it turned out that the script was executed before the page loaded because I placed the script before the body element) and ideas I didn't know how to put into action at the moment (e.g. customize a cursor). It was a fulfilling and rewarding learning experience!
